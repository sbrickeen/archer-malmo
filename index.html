	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<div class="one">
	<p> My experience at Archer Malmo was mind blowing. I really enjoyed how the building felt and looked, it felt like I was in a cozy cabin, escaping the cold. The workers we met were very nice and respectful, showing what good character the company had. I enjoyed learning about all of the different things that a web designer actually does, and it was very interesting. I did not know the designers created a lot of sketches before actually designing the website. It seems like a much more difficult process than I originally thought. All of the sketches and drawings look very difficult to pull off, and if the client is not satisfied, the designers have to think of something new. It seems like a very stressful experience.</p>

	<p> Creating websites for many different clients with various deadlines seems like it could be a lot to handle at times, and sometimes the designers have more than one project to work on at once. The employees all collaborate with each other to help create amazing websites and help each other with various problems they may run into. Even though the job might seem very stressful, it also looks like it could be a lot of fun. Designing websites and writing HTML and CSS is a very enjoyable experience, even if it can be a lot to handle sometimes. The presentation we were shown really helped me understand the world of web design even more than I did before. The class was very respectful during the presentation and allowed everyone to talk without being interrupted, and I learned a lot. Web design is a very interesting career choice, and I am slightly considering it for the future.</p>

	<h1>Atmosphere</h1>

	<div class="three">
	<p> The building was beautiful. When we walked in, they had an amazing Christmas tree set up by the door, and it was absolutely gorgeous. The elavators were really fancy, with golden doors and the Archer Malmo logo on it. The floors felt a little compact, but it was nice. I felt very comfortable while I was there, and I even got to sit on a couch while we watched the presentation. The atmosphere was very comforting and inviting, like a cozy little cottage. The dresscode was pretty laidback, and the employees could even bring their dogs to work with them. We only got to see one dog, but it was still really cool. </p>

	<div class="four">
	<p> We got to see a few different floors in the building. The ceilings were a little low so it might've been hard for some of the taller kids to walk around, and the buildings were a little bit cramped, but it was nice too. We saw one of the office levels, which is where we got to see the presentation. Then we went to the main lobby, and it was very nice. They had TV's on the wall behind the person managing the main desk. Lastly, we were brought down to the lowest floor. While we were waiting for everyone, some kids were getting food from the vending machines in the corner. It was a little disrespectful, but it's okay. They got lectured afterwards. We were brought to a filming room, and it was so cool. They had a big green screen for whenever they needed to create some type of film with artificial backgrounds, and in the corner they were creating a still motion picture thing, but it was really cool. It was like a mini movie set. Then we had to leave because it was getting late.</p>

	<h1>Thoughts for the Future</h1>

	<div class="five">
	<p> I am possibly considering web design to be a career path of mine in the future. I really enjoy writing code and creating a website that somebody can look at and be impressed by. Designing can sometimes be difficult, but it also makes it more enjoyable, especially when the project is finished. Archer Malmo seems like a very enjoyable company to work at, with kind employees and a comfortable work environment. If i decide to pursue some type of web design dream, I will more than likely apply to work at Archer Malmo. Learning about all of the different aspects of web design has helped me realize that I am slightly interested in it and I might want to spend the rest of my life writing HTML for many different people. The most difficult part may be creating the sketches for clients to view the website before it's been created, but I could possibly have somebody else help me with it. The workers at Archer Malmo all seem very helpful and kind, willing to help anybody that needs help on their projects. I loved the feel of the place and where it's located. It's close enough to home so I could visit my parents frequently. </p>

	<p> My experience at Archer Malmo has helped me realize how amazing the world of web design is and how I want to be involved in some way. I'm really glad I got to go on this field trip with my favorite teacher, Mrs. Sinclair. </p>
